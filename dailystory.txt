* How to have a concept of today's story--
Day model that has year, month, day, story fields
and an instance for every day. Use that to schedule stories through the admin and programmatically. 

Algorithm to schedule stories:
Whenever a new day is first viewed, create the Day and find a random unfeatured story to associate with it. 

So maybe we do have a Day object. When Day is created:
 pull a random Story 
 check that it's not from a journal that was featured recently or by an author that was featured recently
 save itself
 view consults today's Day 

View algorithm:
Select today's date Day from Day. 
If it doesn't exist:
 select a random Story that hasn't been featured, 
 create a Day for today
 point today's Day to selected Story
Show the Story that today's Day points to.
