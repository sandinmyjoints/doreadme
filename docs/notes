use jquery ready ajax to load the contact form from an ajax endpoint into the #contact_form div, so that is available when the modal dialog is opened?

Contact page view
	get html for when js is disabled, renders the form on a page
	get ajax should 404.
	post html processes the form by bubbling up to form.is_valid, then calling form_valid or form_invalid.  errors are taken care of by re-rendering the form html. success redirects to the contact_complete view, which renders the contact_complete template in html.
	post ajax should package the response into a json object that also says success: false or true, and errors on the data. then this can be dynamically applied to the elements. success renders a success message (maybe but not necessarily the contact_complete_include). success:false dynamically adds info to the form, but does not re-render it?

	also need to figure out how to destroy the dialog entirely after closing it
